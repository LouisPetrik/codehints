# What is PureScript? 
PureScript is a purely functional programming language created in 2013.
The syntax is almost similar to Haskell, yet, it only compiles to pure JavaScript. 

# Author's Notes 
PureScript is extremely hard to learn, likewise is Haskell. As the language 
offers less freedom and a very unique syntax, it takes a time to get into it. 

# Sources 
As the source for these cheatsheets mainly the official PureScript book and the 
Functional Programming Made Easier book is used. Both are linked below.
