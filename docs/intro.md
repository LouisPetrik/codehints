# Louis' Programming Cheat Sheets 

## Welcome! 

This is the official website for the GitHub Repo of [codehints](https://github.com/LouisPetrik/codehints).


Here, you can find cheat sheets and general ressources, containing examples, on different technologies. 
These technologies include programming languages, frameworks and libraries I am personally interested it. 
Contributing ressources is possible, just reach out to me. 


## Contributing 

Contributing is possible via GitHub. Alternatively, you can send in content, content-drafts or content-ideas 
via Mail: louispetrik@aol.com. 


### Style Guidelines
The following are Guidelines to myself and others for adding contnet. 

Each Markdown file has a header section on top which will be rendered to <head></head>. 
Therefore it holds the title, the description etc. 

Make sure each file at leasts holds a minimal header with a title: 
```markdown
---
title: The title
---

Each technology has one intro.md in its directory. This file always has 
a header like this: 

```markdown 
--- 
title: Introduction to Technology-name 
sidebar_position: 1
slug: /category/technology-name
--- 
```

Each of the files has the h1 headings: 
- What is technology-name? (use cases, projects etc. )
- Code examples (optional)
- Author's Notes (optional)
- Sources 
- Additional Ressources 

Please do not use uncloses XML tags anywhere as this will 
break anything. Thank you.

## Legal stuff 

This website is not an official source of any technology. Neither is it associated with official representatives of any technology. Therefore, it is always true that no claim for the correctness and completeness of the content is to be made. 

Even though this project is open source, I ask that you do not simply copy the page exactly and publish it yourself. The code may be used as a basis for own projects, and single cheat sheets may be issued. 

In case of further questions, feel free to reach out to me via Mail: louispetrik@aol.com.
