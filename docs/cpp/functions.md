# Functions

Terminology: 
The following is a function declaration, which is usually stored in a header file: 

```cpp 
int add(int a, int b); 
```
Then, we usually define them in an actual C++ file: 
```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b; 
}
```


## Passing Functions as parameters 

```cpp
int add (int a, int b) {
  return a + b; 
}

int useFunction(int a, int b, function<int(int, int)> func) {
  return func(a, b); 
}

int main() {
  cout << useFunction(2, 3, &add) << endl; 
}
```

## Virtual functions

B is a subclass of A, and A holds a virtual function. Therefore, we can override it in the B file, resulting in a method, which is able to do something else. 
Code coming soon. 


## Function pointers 

Function pointers help, to assign functions to variables. They also help, to pass functions to other functions, for example. 


```cpp 
void PrintValue(int value) {
  cout << "Value: " << value << endl;
}

void ForEach(const vector<int> &values, void (*func)(int)) {
  for (int value : values) {
    func(value);
  }
}

int main() {
  vector<int> values = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  ForEach(values, PrintValue);
  return 0;
}
```
In the example, the PrintValue function is passed into the ForEach function, so it can be used there in another way. 

## Lambdas 

Lambdas could be viewed as throw-away functions, which help to receive the advantages of a function without the physical presence of a normal function. 
Whenever we have a function pointer, we can use a lambda. 

A simple lambda, saved to a variable, just like in JavaScript: 

```cpp
auto lambda = []() { cout << "Hello world" << endl; };
lambda(); 
```
Special about this definition is, that outside variables cannot be used inside it. To solve this, we can specify everything in the brackets. 
Putting in a "=" means, we want to make everything available inside the function. 

This way, we make the variable available inside it: 
```cpp
int a = 5; 

auto lambda = [a]() { cout << "Hello world" << endl; };
lambda(); 
```

There are many other ways to specify, you can check them out in a C++ reference.
