# What is WebAssembly? 
WebAssembly is a binary instruction format like Assembler, running as a stack-based virtual machine in the world of JavaScript. 
WebAssembly enables us to generate extremely fast code based on programming languages like C, C++, Go or Rust for the browser 
and anywhere else. 

# Author's Notes 
PureScript is extremely hard to learn, likewise is Haskell. As the language 
offers less freedom and a very unique syntax, it takes a time to get into it. 

# Sources 
As the source for these cheatsheets mainly the official PureScript book and the 
Functional Programming Made Easier book is used. Both are linked below.
