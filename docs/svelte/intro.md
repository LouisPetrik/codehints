## What is Svelte 5?

Svelte 5 is a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, known for its compiler-first approach. Unlike traditional frameworks that use a virtual DOM, Svelte compiles components into highly optimized JavaScript at build time, resulting in faster and smaller web applications[1][3][7].

Svelte 5 introduces significant improvements such as native TypeScript support, enhanced reactivity with runes, and the ability to define reusable snippets directly in `.svelte.js` or `.svelte.ts` files. These features simplify state management, reduce boilerplate code, and improve overall developer experience[1][3][9].

## Hello World in Svelte 5

```jsx
<script>
  let message = "Hello world!";
</script>

<p>{message}</p>
```

## More Code Examples

**Building a Counter in Svelte**

```jsx
<script>
  let count = 0;

  function increment() {
    count += 1;
  }
</script>

<p>Counter: {count}</p>
<button on:click={increment}>Increment</button>
```

**Passing Props in Svelte**

```jsx
<!-- Parent Component -->
<script>
  import Child from './Child.svelte';
</script>

<Child name="Max" />
```

```jsx
<!-- Child.svelte -->
<script>
  export let name;
</script>

<p>Hello {name}!</p>
```

**Fetching and Rendering Data**

```jsx
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';

  let task;

  onMount(async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
    task = await response.json();
  });
</script>

{#if task}
  <p>Task name: {task.title}</p>
{:else}
  <p>Loading...</p>
{/if}
```

## Author's Notes

Svelte's compiler-first approach and new features in version 5 enhance performance and developer productivity. The introduction of runes and improved reactivity make it a compelling choice for modern web development.
