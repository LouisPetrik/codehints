# Author's Notes

PureScript is extremely hard to learn, likewise is Haskell. As the language
offers less freedom and a very unique syntax, it takes a time to get into it.

# Sources

As the source for these cheatsheets mainly the official PureScript book and the
Functional Programming Made Easier book is used. Both are linked below.
