# What is AssemblyScript?

AsssemblyScript, in short, ASM, is a programming language that compiles to WebAssembly - only to WebAssembly.
The language is based on TypeScript, but with three huge differences:

-  ASM forces you to provide types, and "any" is not allowed
-  ASM brings in C-style types like 32 bit and 64 bit Integers
-  ASM offers a standard library with low-level functions

At the moment, it is a great choice when you are in the need for fast WASM code, yet want to write something like JavaScript.

## Author's Notes

Already used in production, yet some essential features like closures are missing.
