# Getting started with TypeScript in React

TypeScript can be used with React.js, just like JavaScript can and is.
As TS is a superset of JavaScript, there is, depending on compiler options,
no need to actually use TypeScript features. In the following, we'll have
a look at unique parts of TSX and how to get started.

## TypeScript in create-react-app

There are two ways to get started:

```bash
yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
```

or:

```
yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
```

## TypeScript in Next.js

For Next.js, there are also two ways of getting started:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --ts
```

or:

```bash
yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
```
