# What is TypeScript? 

# Author's notes 
Learning TypeScript is absolutely worth it. 
Yet, many developers fall into the trap of using TypeScript to spam their code with type definitions. While bringing in 
types is the idea behind TypeScript, it is capable of much more than this. 

For getting started with TS, write JavaScript code at first, and bring in TS-exclusive stuff when you feel comfortable with it and understand, what 
you are actually trying. As TS is just a superset of JavaScript, pure JS code runs perfectly in TypeScript.
