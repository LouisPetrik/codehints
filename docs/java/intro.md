# What is Java?

Java is one of the most popular programming languages of the 21th century.
The object-oriented programming language was created by Oracle in 1995, and can be used for many different
purposes. It might be the programming language that pushed the object-oriented style of programming the most, and is pretty
infamous for its boilerplate-loaded way of printing hello world.

# Hello World in Java

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

You can execute it with running

```bash
javac Main.java && java Main
```

# Author's Notes

I had to learn it for multiple courses in University and never really liked it. Especially not, because Java really forces object oriented programming onto the programmer. Yet, one must admit that Java is evolving and isn't too bad for beginners.
